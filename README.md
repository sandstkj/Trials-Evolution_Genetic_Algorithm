# Trials-Evolution_Genetic_Algorithm
A machine learning project I'm working on that will play Trials Evolution, utilizing reinforcement learning to solve for a longest survival distance possible.

Currently, the program utilizes inconsistencies among platforms like dual monitors, a 1600x900 resolution game window, and taskbar on the bottom of the screen. This is mostly due to inconsistencies with regards to getting mouse positions, pixel colors with games, and the active window. The final implementation of this program will be universal.
